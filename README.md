# Face-recognition-Based-door-lock-system
A face recognition-based door lock system is a security mechanism that uses facial recognition technology to grant access to a premises or unlock a door. It is a biometric authentication method that analyzes and verifies an individual's facial features to determine their identity and grant or deny access.

Pickle and Model Persistence in Python

In Python, pickle is a standard library module used for serializing and deserializing Python objects. It allows you to save Python objects (like models) to a file, and later, load them back into memory. Pickling is a way of converting a Python object into a byte stream, and unpickling is the process of restoring the byte stream back into a Python object.

How Pickle Works with Models:

When it comes to machine learning models, the pickle module is particularly useful for model persistence. After training a machine learning model, you can save it to a file using pickle.dump() or joblib.dump() (a more efficient alternative to pickle from the joblib library). This serialized model file can be loaded later using pickle.load() or joblib.load() to make predictions without having to retrain the model.

Description:

The provided Python script, datacollect.py, is designed to collect comprehensive person information and store it in a CSV file named "person_information.csv". The script utilizes the CSV module to handle data storage and provides a user-friendly interface to gather person details such as Name, Age, Gender, Email, Phone, and Address. The user can add multiple people's information one after another until they choose to stop.

How the Script Works:

The script starts by importing the csv module, which allows us to read and write data in CSV format.
The collect_data_to_person function is defined, which takes the file name (in this case, "person_information.csv") as input.
Inside the function, a CSV file is created (if it doesn't exist) or opened for appending data in case it already exists.
The fieldnames for the CSV are defined as ['Name', 'Age', 'Gender', 'Email', 'Phone', 'Address'].
The script then enters a loop to gather person information continuously until the user decides to stop.
Inside the loop, the user is prompted to provide the person's details one by one, and the information is stored in variables.
The collected data is then written as a new row in the CSV file using the csv.DictWriter object.
The user is asked whether they want to add information for another person. If they respond "yes," the loop continues; otherwise, the loop terminates.
Once the user completes data entry for all the individuals, the script concludes by informing the user that data collection is complete.
